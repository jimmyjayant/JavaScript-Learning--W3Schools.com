            <strong>JavaScript</strong> was invented by <strong>Brendan Eich</strong> in 1995. 
            <br>
            It was developed for <strong>Netscape 2</strong>, and became the <strong>ECMA-262</strong> standard in 1997. 
            <br>
            After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.5. 
            <br>
            (Identical to ES5). 
            <br>
            <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> (IE4) was the first browser to support ECMA-262 Edition 1 (ES1).

        <div>
            In 1996, Netscape and Brendan Eich took JavaScript to the ECMA international standards organization, and a technical committee (TC39) was created to develop the language. 
            <br>
            ECMA-262 Edition 1 was released in June 1997.

        <div>
            When the TC39 committee got together in Oslo in 2008, to agree on ECMAScript 4, they were divided into 2 very different camps. 
            <br>
            <strong>The ECMAScript 3.1 Camp: </strong>
            <br>
            Microsoft and Yahoo who wanted an incremental upgrade from ES3.

            <br>
            <strong>The ECMAScript 4 Camp: </strong>
            <br>
            Adobe, Mozilla, Opera, and Google who wanted a massive ES4 upgrade. 
            <br>
            August 13, 2008, Brendan Eich wrote an <a href="https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/es-discuss/2008-August/006837.html" target="_blank">email</a>:-

            <i>
                It's no secret that the JavaScript standards body, Ecma's Technical Committee 39, has been split for over a year, while some members favoring ES4, a major fourth edition to ECMA-262, and others advocating ES3.1 based on the existing ECMA-262 Edition 3 (ES3) specification. Now, I'm happy to report, the split is over. 
            </i>

            <br>
            <br>

            The solution was to work together: 
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>ECMAScript 4 was renamed to ES5</li>
                <li>ES5 should be an incremental upgrade to ECMAScript 3.</li>
                <li>Features of ECMAScript 4 should be picked up in later versions.</li>
                <li>TC39 should develop a new major release, biger in scope than ES5.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <br>

            The planned new release (ES6) was codenamed "Harmony" (Because of the split is created?). 
            <br>
            ES5 was a huge success. It was released in 2009, and all major browsers (including Internet Explorer) were fully compliant by July 2013.
