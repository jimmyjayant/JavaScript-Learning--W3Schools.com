        <div>
            JavaScript variables can belong to the <strong>local</strong> or <strong>global</strong> scope. 
            <br>
            Global variables can be made local (private) with <strong>closures</strong>. 
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2>
            Global Variables 
        </h2>

        <div>
            A <span class="edit">function</span> can access all variables defined <strong>inside</strong> the function, like this. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <p id="demo1"></p>

            <br>
            <br>
            But a <span class="edit">function</span> can also access variables defined <strong>outside</strong> the function, like this. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <p id="demo2"></p>

            <br>
            <br>
            In the last example, <strong>a</strong> is a <strong>global</strong> variable. 
            <br>
            In a web page, global variables belong to the page. 
            <br>
            Global variables can be used (and changed) by all other scripts in the page. 
            <br>
            In the first example, <strong>a</strong> is a <strong>local</strong> variable. 
            <br>
            A local variable can only be used inside the function where it is defined. It is hidden from other functions and other scripting code. 
            <br>
            Global and local variables with the same name are different variables. Modifying one, does not modify the other. 

            <br>
            <br>

            <div class="edit1">
                <span style="font-size:3rem">Note</span>
                <br>
                Variables created <strong>without</strong> a declaration keyword (<span class="edit">var</span>, <span class="edit">let</span> or <span class="edit">const</span>) are always global, even if they are created inside a function. 
            </div>
            
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <p id="demo3"></p>
        </div>

        <h2>
            Variable Lifetime 
        </h2>

        <div>
            Global variables live until the page is discarded, like when you navigate to another page or close the window. 
            <br>
            Local variables have short lives. They are created when the function is invoked, and deleted when the function is finished. 
        </div>

        <h2>
            A Counter Dilemma 
        </h2>

        <div>
            Suppose you want to use a variable for counting something, and you want this counter to be available to all functions. 
            <br>
            You could use a global variable, and a <span class="edit">function</span> to increase the counter. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <p id="demo4"></p>

            <br>
            <br>
            There is a problem with the solution above:- Any code on the page can change the counter, without calling add(). 
            <br>
            The counter should be local to the <span class="edit">add()</span> function, to prevent other code from changing it. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <p id="demo5"></p>

            <br>
            <br>
            It did not work because we display the global counter instead of the local counter. 
            <br>
            We can remove the global counter and access the local counter by letting the function return it. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <button type="button" onclick="myFunction4()">Count!</button>
            <p id="demo6">0</p>

            <br>
            <br>
            It did not work because we reset the local counter every time we call the function. 
            <br>
            <strong>
                A JavaScript inner function can solve this. 
            </strong>
        </div>

        <h2>
            JavaScript Nested Functions 
        </h2>

        <div>
            All functions have access to the global scope. 
            <br>
            In fact, in JavaScript, all functions have access to the scope "above" them. 
            <br>
            JavaScript supports nested functions. Nested functions have access to the scope "above" them. 
            <br>
            In this example, the inner function <span class="edit">plus()</span> has access to the <span class="edit">counter</span> variable in the parent function. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <p id="demo7"></p>

            <br>
            This could have solved the counter dilemma, if we could reach the <span class="edit">plus()</span> function from the outside. 
            <br>
            We also need to find a way to execute <span class="edit">counter=0</span> only once. 
            <br>
            <strong>
                We need a closure. 
            </strong>
        </div>

        <h2>
            JavaScript Closures 
        </h2>

        <div>
            Remember self-invoking functions? What does this function do? 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            <button type="button" onclick="myFunction5()">Count!</button>
            <br>
            <p id="demo8"></p>

            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>
                Example Explained 
            </h2>

            <br>
            The variable <span class="edit">add</span> is assigned to the return value of a self-invoking function. 
            <br>
            The self-invoking function only runs once. It sets the counter to zero (0), and returns a function expression. 
            <br>
            This way add becomes a function. The "wonderful" part is that it can access the counter in the parent scope. 
            <br>
            This is called a JavaScript <strong>closure</strong>. It makes it possible for a function to have "<strong>private</strong>" variables. 
            <br>
            The counter is protected by the scope of the anonymous function, and can only be changed using the add function. 
            <br>
            <p class="edit1">
                A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <script>
            myFunction1();

            function myFunction1() {
                let a = 4;
                document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = a * a;
            }

            let b = 4;
            myFunction2();
            function myFunction2() {
                document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = b * b;
            }

            myFunction3();

            document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = c * c;
            function myFunction3() {
                c = 4;
            }

            //Initiate counter:- 
            let counter = 0;

            //Function to increment counter:- 
            function add() {
                counter += 1;
            }

            //Call add() 3 times:- 
            add();
            add();
            add();

            //The counter should now be 3:- 
            document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML = 
            "The counter is:- " + counter;

            //Initiate counter1:- 
            let counter1 = 0;

            //Function to increment counter1:- 
            function add1() {
                let counter1 = 0;
                counter1 += 1;

            add1();
            add1();
            add1();

            //The result is not 3 because you mix up the global and local counter1:- 
            document.getElementById("demo5").innerHTML = 
            "The counter is:- " + counter1;

            //Function to increment counter:-

                let counter = 0;
                counter += 1;
                return counter;
            }

            //Trying to increment the counter:- 
            function myFunction4() {
                document.getElementById("demo6").innerHTML = add2();
            }

            function add3()
            {
                let counter = 0;
                function plus() {
                    counter += 1;
                }
                plus();
                return counter;
            }
