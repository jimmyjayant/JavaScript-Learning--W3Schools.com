        <div>
            Programming code might contain syntax errors, or logical errors. 
            <br>
            Many of these errors are difficult to diagnose. 
            <br>
            Often, when programming code contain errors, nothing will happen. There are no error messages, and you will get no indications where to search for errors. 
            <br>
            Searching for (and fixing) errors in programming code is called code debugging.

        <h2>
            JavaScript Debuggers 
        </h2>

        <div>
            Debugging is not easy. But fortunately, all modern browsers have a built-in JavaScript debugger. 
            <br>
            Built-in debuggers can be turned on or off, forcing errors to be reported to the user. 
            <br>
            With a debugger, you can also set breakpoints (places where code execution can be stopped), and examine variables while the code is executing. 
            <br>
            Normally (otherwise follow the steps at the bottom of this page), you activate debugging in your browser with the F12 key, and select "Console" in the debugger menu. 
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2>
            The console.log() Method 
        </h2>

        <div>
            If your browser supports debugging, you can use <span class="edit">console.log()</span> to display JavaScript values in the debugger window. 
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            Activate debugging in your browser (Chrome, IE, Firefox) with F12, and select "Console" in the debugger menu. 
            <br>
            And check the value of the variable c = a + b where a is 5 and b is 6. 
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h2>
            Setting Breakpoints 
        </h2>

        <div>
            In the debugger window, you can set breakpoints in the JavaScript code. 
            <br>
            At each breakpoint, JavaScript will stop executing, and let you examine JavaScript values. 
            <br>
            After examining values, you can resume the execution of code (typically with a play button).  
        </div>

        <h2>
            The debugger Keyword 
        </h2>

        <div>
            The <span class="edit">debugger</span> keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function. 
            <br>
            This has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the debugger. 
            <br>
            If no debugging is available, the debugger statement has no effect. 
            <br>
            With the debugger turned on, this code will stop executing before it executes the third line. 
            <br>
            <p class="edit1">
                let x = 15 * 5;
                <br>
                debugger;
                <br>
                document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            Example:- 
            <br>
            Below p element with id="demo1" will show 75 which is variable x = 15 X 5. But if you activate the console mode (debugging mode) by pressing F12, and refreshing the browser, then the p element WILL NOT SHOW 75. 
            <br>
            <p id="demo1"></p>
        </div>
